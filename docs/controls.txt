1 joystick:
    - turning 
    - difference of speed between two sets of wheels
    - x y coordinates
        - x positive turns right
        - x negative turns left
        - higher absolute value = faster/sharper turn
2 joystick:
    - moving and speed
    - x y coordinates
      - x   ignore
      - y positive: forward, higher the number, faster the speed
          negative: backwards, higher the number, faster the speed
